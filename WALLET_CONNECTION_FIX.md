# Production Wallet Connection Fix

## Problem Fixed
TON Connect modal was not appearing when users tried to pay without a connected wallet.

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes:

1. **Smart Payment Flow**: Payment button now properly handles wallet connection
2. **State Management**: Automatic payment continuation after wallet connection
3. **Modal Handling**: Ensures existing modals are closed before opening new ones
4. **Error Recovery**: Fallback to header Connect Wallet button if issues occur

### How It Works:

- **Wallet Connected**: Payment executes immediately
- **No Wallet**: Opens TON Connect modal, stores payment data, continues after connection
- **Error**: Clear error message with fallback instructions

## Files Modified:
- `src/components/PaymentButtonTon.tsx`: Enhanced payment flow with wallet connection
- `src/main.tsx`: Production-ready TON Connect configuration

## Production Ready
✅ Optimized for `https://lfg-ton-marketplace.vercel.app`
✅ Clean production code without debugging
✅ Reliable wallet connection flow
✅ Error handling and fallbacks

## Problem Description
Previously, when users tried to pay for a service without first connecting their wallet through the dedicated "Connect Wallet" button, the wallet connection process would fail. The TON Connect modal would open but the connection wouldn't properly establish, causing the payment process to abort.

## Root Cause
The original implementation in `PaymentButtonTon.tsx` would:
1. Check if wallet is connected
2. If not connected, call `tonConnectUI.openModal()` 
3. Immediately return from the function
4. No mechanism to retry payment after wallet connection

This approach didn't wait for the wallet connection to complete or provide a way to continue the payment process after successful connection.

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added State Management**:
   - `isPendingConnection`: Tracks when wallet connection is in progress
   - `pendingPaymentData`: Stores payment details while wallet connects

2. **Added Effect Handler**:
   - `useEffect` monitors wallet connection state
   - Automatically executes payment when wallet connects and payment is pending

3. **Refactored Payment Logic**:
   - Extracted payment execution into separate `executePayment` function
   - Modified `handlePay` to properly handle wallet connection flow

4. **Enhanced UI Feedback**:
   - Button shows "Подключение..." / "Connecting..." during connection
   - Button is disabled during connection process

### Code Changes in `PaymentButtonTon.tsx`:

```typescript
// Added new state variables
const [isPendingConnection, setIsPendingConnection] = useState(false);
const [pendingPaymentData, setPendingPaymentData] = useState<{amount: number, comment?: string} | null>(null);

// Added effect to handle wallet connection completion
useEffect(() => {
  if (wallet?.account && isPendingConnection && pendingPaymentData) {
    // Wallet just connected and we have pending payment data
    setIsPendingConnection(false);
    const { amount: pendingAmount, comment: pendingComment } = pendingPaymentData;
    setPendingPaymentData(null);
    
    // Execute the payment with the stored data
    executePayment(pendingAmount, pendingComment);
  }
}, [wallet?.account, isPendingConnection, pendingPaymentData]);

// Extracted payment logic into separate function
const executePayment = useCallback(async (paymentAmount: number, paymentComment?: string) => {
  // ... payment execution logic
}, [tonConnectUI, userFriendlyAddress, wallet]);

// Modified handlePay to properly handle wallet connection
const handlePay = async () => {
  // ... validation logic
  
  if (!wallet?.account) {
    // Store payment data for execution after connection
    setPendingPaymentData({ amount: paymentAmount, comment });
    setIsPendingConnection(true);
    
    toast("Подключение кошелька...");
    try {
      await tonConnectUI.openModal();
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle modal opening errors
      setIsPendingConnection(false);
      setPendingPaymentData(null);
    }
    return;
  }
  
  // If wallet already connected, execute payment immediately
  await executePayment(paymentAmount, comment);
};
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Wallet Already Connected
1. User clicks payment button
2. Payment executes immediately
3. No changes to existing behavior

### Scenario 2: Wallet Not Connected
1. User clicks payment button
2. System stores payment details in state
3. Sets `isPendingConnection = true`
4. Opens TON Connect modal
5. User connects wallet in modal
6. `useEffect` detects wallet connection
7. Automatically executes stored payment
8. Clears pending state

## Benefits

1. **Seamless User Experience**: Users can initiate payment directly from service cards without prior wallet connection
2. **No Manual Retry**: Payment automatically continues after wallet connection
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Proper cleanup if wallet connection fails
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of connection status
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing wallet connection functionality unchanged

## Testing Instructions

To test the fix:

1. **Test with disconnected wallet**:
   - Ensure wallet is disconnected
   - Click payment button on any service card
   - Verify TON Connect modal opens
   - Connect wallet in modal
   - Verify payment automatically proceeds

2. **Test with connected wallet**:
   - Connect wallet first using header button
   - Click payment button on service card
   - Verify payment works immediately

3. **Test error scenarios**:
   - Cancel wallet connection modal
   - Verify proper error handling and state cleanup
